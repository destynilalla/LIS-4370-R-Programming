#STEP 1
# Install and load packages
library(pryr)
library(ISLR)
library(boot)
library(plyr)

# Read data
Student_assignment <- read.table("Assignment 6 Dataset.txt", header = TRUE, sep= ",")

# Calculate mean with plyr
StudentAverage <- ddply(Student_assignment, "Sex", transform, Grade_Average = mean(Grade))

# Write the resulting output to a file
write.table(StudentAverage, "StudentAverage.txt", sep = ",")

#STEP 2
# Filter the dataframe to include only rows where the student name contains the letter i
i_students <- subset(Student_assignment, grepl("i", Name, ignore.case = TRUE))

# Write the names to a file separated by commas (CSV)
write.table(i_students, "i_Students.csv", sep = ",")

#STEP 3
# Choose the file to save the filtered data set
filtered_file <- file.choose()

# Write the filtered data set to the chosen file and convert it to a CSV file
write.csv(i_students, filtered_file, row.names = FALSE)
